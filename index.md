## Values

* Cooperation

* Forgiveness

* Humor


## Personality

I treat all human interactions as a way to learn something new. Be it a fact about the person I'm talking to or a chance for them to teach me
something new. Because of that, I find myself to be a self-taught accidental socialite. I love getting to know new people, and always enjoy 
the opportunity to have a conversation.


## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Feedback is always best received the same way as a fine whiskey: straight, and without watering it down. One on ones are the best place for feedback.

Thanks as a recognition for a job well done doesn't have to be public, even a PM thanking me for help is enough to make me
feel all warm and fuzzy inside.


## Work Patterns

I live in San Jose, CA. So, my working hours are in PST.

I try to keep my working hours to the typical 9-5 office schedule. I try not to
work outside of regular business hours. However, I have been known to take a break during the day,
and wrap things up after hours. Availability from 11:30 to 1:30 is hit or miss.

Late morning and early/mid afternoon are my peak productivity hours. I try to center meetings around my
lunch break mid-day. After 3PM, my productivity sowly wanes into nothing as the day progresses. Lastly,
I will almost always take an espresso break sometime between 2 and 4 PM, usually 3 PM.

The joys of remote first work is that I am also very flexible. I can start early or later, as needed.

Occasionally I plan to be physically in the office.


## Communication Preferences

My email inbox is a black hole filled with marketing cruft and automated messages. Expect any emails to disappear
and never be acknowledged, and be pleasantly surprised if they are. I try to listen for the Slack notification, and
am on every major chatting App - Telegram, Signal, Slack, Discord, etc etc. In the 21st century, it's harder
to be avoided than it is to be reached, in my opinion.

Slack is your best bet to reach me during working hours.

After Hours?

I am liable to ignore my phone (unless on-call or continuing a previous task) after 7PM. Most importantly, I am an avid motorcyclist outside of work, 
so if I am riding I will be unable to respond. During the week I am at the gym by around 5:30, most days.


## How To Know Iâ€™ve Gone To The Dark Side

I tend to procrastinate when overloaded with too many tasks. If I keep putting things off and never get around to doing them,
that is a good sign that I am overloaded and have too much going on.


### Warning Signs

Some days are better than others. It's not uncommon for me to have my webcam disabled and to sit on mute, so don't worry if that's the case.

I consider myself a stable and disciplined individual. If I am having a difficult time, I will discuss it with my supervisor and figure out
a way to disconnect and recharge.


### How to help

Good memes are always appreciated - I always enjoy a good laugh. If that fails, a virtual drink shared with coworkers is always a fun time.


## Me Being Me

I talk *a lot*. I know this, and do my best to try to pay attention in a conversation. Usually I am good at picking up on when I am speaking 
over people, but sometimes I miss it. If that happens, I apologize, and if I am interrupting you, please please please tell me and I promise
I will not take it personally.


## Pet Peeves

None of my Pet Peeves are related to work. So, in the interest of putting something here, I will list my biggest one:

Ordering an Espresso and getting an Expresso back.


## Career Goals & Future Interests

I love all of the good meta-questions that come up around SRE/DevOps, and find myself fascinated by the immediate questions that DevOps brings
to the table, which is: How does my software actually work in production? How do I maintain it and set myself up with tools and methodologies that
will allow me to build and _maintain_ an amazing product and scale it.


## Areas for Development

Improving my listening skills is my biggest area I am always working on. I am a speed reader and typer, but I always want to work on using my ears more.


## Ask Me About


* Aircooled Volkswagens

* Motorcycling

* Cooking

* 3D Printing

* Traveling

In general, I love learning! I love picking up new skills and hobbies, especially if it's something productive that I can do with my hands.
